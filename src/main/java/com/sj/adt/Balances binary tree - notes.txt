Balanced tree

Unbalanced tree

    Balance factor:-
                    The difference between the heights of left and right sub-trees.

        4

    left height: 0
    right height: 0
    balance factor: 0

            4
          2

        left height: 1
        right height: 0
        balance factor: -1

            4
                5
                    6

        left height: 0
        right height: 2
        balance factor: 2

    Heavy:-
            the state when the balance factor of a node differs by more than one.


            4
          2     5
        1

        left height: 2
        right height: 1
        balance factor: -1


            4
          2     5
        1           6

        left height: 2
        right height: 2
        balance factor: 0

To make an unbalanced tree to balanced tree, we need to do rotations
1. Left rotation
2. Right rotation
3. Left-Right rotation
4. Right-left rotation

-----------------------------------
1. Left rotation
    a.  Right child becomes the new root
    b.  Left child of the new root is assigned to the right child of the old root
    c.  Previous root becomes the new root's left child.

2. Right rotation
    a.  Left child becomes the new root
    b.  Right child of the new root is assigned to left child of the old root
    c.  Previous root becomes the new root's right child

3. Left-Right rotation
    Left rotation of a right rotated tree
    a.  Right rotate the right child of the root node
    b.  Left rotate the root.

4. Right-Left rotation
    Right rotation of left rotated tree.
    a.  Left rotation of left child of the root node
    b.  Right rotation the root.


Now, when should we use what rotation?

If the tree is left heavy and if the left child is right heavy,
            then perform Right-Left rotation
otherwise perform right rotation

If the tree is right heavy and it's right child is left heavy
        then perform Left-Right rotation
otherwise perform left rotation

If the tree is neither left  or right heavy
    then the tree is balanced
